xtheme - An XTerm/UXTerm/RXVT/URXVT themeing tool

Generates .Xresources and .Xdefaults based on a simpler theme configuration
file format than the standard XRDB one, made specifically for themeing.



Usage: xtheme <your config file>

Dependencies:
gcc, glibc (you probably already have both of these.)

Building:
$ make

Installing:
# make install



Why?

Because I've gotten tired of searching for the options I want for my XResources
file - the names tend to be a bit weird, they're long and repetitive, and for
some reason various sources of documentation seem to disagree on what options
are available to use. To solve this problem, I wrote my own, simpler format
that includes only themeing-related options that a sane person would actually
want to use. I also documented each option clearly below.



How to use:

The configuration file is in an extremely simple format designed to be as
human-readable and concise as possible. It serves as a shorthand to the
somewhat longer XRDB format that is typically required to customize XTerm.

When executed with the path to a configuration file, xtheme will parse the file,
generate a .Xresources file in your home directory, symlink it to .Xdefaults,
and then execute `xrdb -merge .Xresources`. After this, you must restart xterm
to see the changes.

There are three types of options that can be set:

 - Flags
   These options are simply listed on a line, and they enable or disable a
   certain feature. No value is given for this sort of option.

 - Values
   These options have a specific value that should come after them on the
   same line, separated by a space.

 - Lists
   These options are given on a line on their own, followed by a certain number
   of lines, each containing a single value for the list.

Please note that there cannot be extra indentation or whitespace on property
lines, and lists cannot have empty lines in between the list entries.

Any lines that are not valid configuration options will simply be silently
ignored, allowing for any non-option line to serve as a comment.

Colors must be specified in XRDB-compatible formats: Hex colors (#xxxxxx) and
basic color values (red, green, blue, etc.) are recommended.

OPTIONS THAT CAN BE SPECIFIED:

 - color fg (Value)
   Sets the foreground color to the one specified.

 - color bg (Value)
   Sets the background color to the one specified.

 - color cursor (Value)
   Sets the cursor color to the one specified.

 - color bold (Value)
   Sets the bold color to the one specified. This will also tell XTerm to use
   colored text for "bold" instead of actual bold text.

 - color italic (Value)
   Sets the italic color to the one specified. This will also tell XTerm to use
   colored text for "italic" instead of actual italic text.

 - color underline (Value)
   Sets the underline color to the one specified. This will also tell XTerm to
   use colored text for "underline" instead of actual underlined text.

 - colors (List)
   Sets all 16 terminal colors (color0 to color15). These colors must be
   specified in proper order on the following lines. 16 lines of color values
   must follow.

 - colors multi (List)
   Sets all 16 terminal colors (color0 to color15), except the first 8 are
   identical to the last 8 (color0 is the same as color8, color1 is the same
   as color9, etc.) Thus, only 8 lines of color values must follow.

 - font face (Value)
   Sets the font to the one whose name is specified.

 - font size (Value)
   Sets the font's size, in points, to the value specified.

 - padding (value)
   Sets the padding around the outer edges of the terminal, in pixels, to the
   value specified

 - cursor blink (Flag)
   Makes the cursor blink.
